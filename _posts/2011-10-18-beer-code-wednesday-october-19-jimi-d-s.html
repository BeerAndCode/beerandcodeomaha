<p>Hey everyone it's that time again.  Time to get out and have a brew, write some code, talk about code and well, whatever else you can with like-minded people.  I personally have written and erased tons and tons of code in the last month.  On top of that I'm getting ready for a few App launches.  I'm ready for a October Beer &amp;&amp; Code.</p>&#13;
<p>We are meeting at <a href="http://www.jimids.com/">Jimi D's</a> sort of by the Aksarban Village off 63rd and Center.  Here is a link on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=jimi+d's+omaha,+ne&amp;ll=41.237996,-96.010208&amp;spn=0.018492,0.018947&amp;client=safari&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=jimi+d's&amp;hnear=0x87938dc8b50cfced:0x46424d4fae37b604,Omaha,+NE&amp;cid=0,0,8971499154469531934&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A">Google Maps</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>When?  After 5PM until people leave... usually 8pm or 9pm.</p>&#13;
<p>They have a "room" reserved under the name Andy.  Its by power outlets (i'm told).  I've personally checked this place out and their Wifi was solid.  Their beers are good, their food was great too; come hungry and thirsty.  It was noisy when I was there, so be ready for that.  </p>&#13;
<p>I know of a few new faces who are planning to be there.  </p>&#13;
<p>Also, I'd like to hear some feedback and ideas for a rad end of the year party.  More on that later, but while you are there hit me up with some ideas.</p>
