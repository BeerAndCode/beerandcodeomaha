<p>Beer &amp;&amp; Code is happening Tuesday May 24, 2011 at The Crescent Moon!  It seems like every time we meet up someone brings up wanting us to have it at Crescent Moon.  So finally we are.  If you have ever been there, you know... it gets packed!  I'll do my best to get there before 5pm to get us a table.  I phoned them to let them know a group of us are coming, but as you know most places forget.  </p>&#13;
<p>No matter what, its a great place, cool atmosphere, tons of great drinks, some food even, and wifi that usually works well.  My understanding is that power may be a issue so make sure your laptop is charged.</p>&#13;
