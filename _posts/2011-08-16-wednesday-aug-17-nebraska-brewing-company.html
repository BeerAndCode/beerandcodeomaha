<p>Its that time again!  Lets get out, code, chat with others and drink ourselves a tasty brew.  </p>&#13;
<p>This month we are checking out <a href="http://www.nebraskabrewingco.com/main.asp">Nebraska Brewing Company</a>.  I have heard great things about this place, its beer and their food.  I personally <em>haven't</em> been here to check it out; which I do for every place.  I apologize in advanced if something about it doesn't work out. </p>&#13;
<p>I called in our reservation.  We are upstairs at a bigger table.  I am told their wifi should handle us and they have power upstairs for us.  </p>&#13;
<p>I am announcing this one late because I had called them Sunday for the reservation and I didn't get a call back for the reservation on Monday; and as things go I didn't call them on Monday either.  Things happen, I'm sure they were just busy... I was.</p>&#13;
