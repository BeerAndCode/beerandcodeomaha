<p>I'm very excited to announce that the Omaha Beer &amp;&amp; Code group is going to meet at the <a href="http://www.luckybucketbrewing.com/">Lucky Bucket Brewery</a> this month.  They have a <em>tasting room</em> with wifi, tables, and the typical needed room to write/talk code and have a good drink.  I'm told there will be six taps of all the Lucky Bucket brews you can taste.  I know they just released a spring brew, so do try that.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Come early!</em>  The place officially opens at 4pm.  They will be doing tours of the brewery for $3.  I'm planning to make it for a tour.</p>&#13;
<p>They close at 7pm, a little earlier than we normally go until.  <em>Don't show up late.</em></p>&#13;
<p><strong>Date</strong>: Wednesday April 18, 2012</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Place</strong>:  Lucky Bucket Brewry (the tasting room).  </p>&#13;
