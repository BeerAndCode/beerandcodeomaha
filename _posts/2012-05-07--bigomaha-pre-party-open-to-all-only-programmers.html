<p>Coming to #<a href="http://www.bigomaha.com">BigOmaha</a> this year?  In the area, but not going to #BigOmaha?  Either way, Great!  If you follow this blog (or Twitter feed) you will be happy to know there is a party just for you.</p>&#13;
<p>I am throwing a little get-together (pre-party?!) for all Coders in the area.  Its at the <a href="http://www.themattomaha.com/">Old Mattress Factory</a> down town on Wednesday, starting at 5PM.  We have the downstairs party room reserved for us!  ... just tell them you are here for the Beer &amp;&amp; Code party.  Programmers only, trolls stay away.  <img height="28" src="http://www.droidforums.net/forum/attachments/off-topic-forum/39609d1314570876-r-u-hot-pretty-handsome-cute-troll.gif" width="40" /> </p>&#13;
<p>For those that don't know, this is <strong>walking distance</strong> from the Official Opening Party at the Slowdown (<a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2012/05/the-big-omaha-2012-schedule">see schedule</a>).  <strong>Here is The Slowdown and Old Mattress Factory on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Old+Mattress+Factory+Bar,+North+13th+Street,+Omaha,+NE&amp;daddr=the+slowdown&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=41.26504,-95.933775&amp;sspn=0.005811,0.004919&amp;geocode=FTyjdQIdLS5I-iEQuSAyb0gQbikh4ETVsI-ThzG_KaodtST0-A%3BFVWtdQId2ilI-iGRmsxsBpBEPSkN3pxbto-ThzFh9qubDKSshQ&amp;oq=old+mattress+fac&amp;t=h&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=ltm&amp;z=18">Google Maps.</a>  </strong>The Old Mattress Factory has a wide array of craft beers.  Since that is half way what Beer &amp;&amp; Code is all about, I wanted to make sure we had a good place for that.  They have parking at the Old Mattress Factory if you need, i think its a few dollars though.</p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>This is open to all programmers in the area!  </strong></em>The idea was to connect some of the folks traveling from out of town and the local Omaha people together.  So many programmers come to Omaha for this conference, and it just seems to obvious to get you all connected before the festivities.  My hope is that there are some good connections made for everyone at this pre-party.  If not, at least we have a good place to drink and talk about the next few days...</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Where</strong>:  Old Mattress Factory - 501 North 13th Street Omaha, NE 68102 (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Old+Mattress+Factory+Bar,+North+13th+Street,+Omaha,+NE&amp;daddr=the+slowdown&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=41.26504,-95.933775&amp;sspn=0.005811,0.004919&amp;geocode=FTyjdQIdLS5I-iEQuSAyb0gQbikh4ETVsI-ThzG_KaodtST0-A%3BFVWtdQId2ilI-iGRmsxsBpBEPSkN3pxbto-ThzFh9qubDKSshQ&amp;oq=old+mattress+fac&amp;t=h&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=ltm&amp;z=18">Map!</a>)</p>&#13;
