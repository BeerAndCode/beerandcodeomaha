<p>Yup, I am aware of that.</p>&#13;
<p>If you don't already know, its just a Tumblr site and I picked the first template that had an ice layout.  Originally had intentions to change the css, but got busy and never got around to that.  </p>&#13;
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:  We have a great community, have everyone make a website.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Join</strong>:  Adam Lassek took on managing the GitHub repository for the site.  Go follow the <a href="https://github.com/alassek">Beer &amp;&amp; Code (Omaha) website development there</a>.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Check out:  </strong>Seattle has a great site, <a href="http://seattle.beerandcode.org/">check it out</a>.  In fact we forked from it.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Future:  </strong>We are planning to have multiple location websites (i.e.:  omaha.beerandcode.org).  Soon there will be a totally revamped main site (<a href="http://www.beerandcode.org">www.beerandcode.org</a>).  I have the ideas on what to put there, but need some help with designers who are willing to take on the challenge.  Wan to join?  Email me:  andy@ninthdivision.com.</p>&#13;
<p>Talk more!</p>
