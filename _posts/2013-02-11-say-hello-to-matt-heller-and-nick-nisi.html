<p>Say hi to Matt Heller &nbsp;(<a href="http://twitter.com/whatevermatt">@whatevermatt</a>) and Nick Nisi (<a href="http://twitter.com/nicknisi">@nicknisi</a>)!</p>
<p>By now you've probably met Matt Heller and Nick Nisi. &nbsp;They are going to be taking over for me to keep the Beer &amp;&amp; Code magic alive here in Omaha. &nbsp;<span>I will still come to Beer &amp;&amp; Code, just not every single month. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A few things let up to this. &nbsp;First, I've always felt Beer &amp;&amp; Code can be more than it is. &nbsp;I can not do this on my own, heck I've tried and it just didn't go very far. &nbsp;Things like websites, reaching out to the other locations, and getting word out sooner are all things I wish I could do. &nbsp;Second, my time this year is going to continue being more and more limited. &nbsp;I'll keep you all informed with that as things come to pass.</p>
<p>So in order to keep moving forward, Nick and Matt are the main guys here in Omaha. &nbsp;They will organize each monthly event, get the website from suck to (at least) useable, and reach out to all your Beer &amp;&amp; Coders. &nbsp;I really look forward to their direction.</p>
<p>Finally, I've always said that as long as people show up then we will keep this thing going. &nbsp;If you like the event, keep showing your pretty faces monthly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>-Andy</p>
