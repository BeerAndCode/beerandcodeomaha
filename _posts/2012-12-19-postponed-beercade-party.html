<p><strong>We are postponing our party tonight.</strong></p>&#13;
<p><a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NEZ052&amp;warncounty=NEC055&amp;firewxzone=NEZ052&amp;local_place1=&amp;product1=Blizzard+Warning">Given there is a Blizzard Warning</a>, the fact that there is no parking on Maple Street, and of course <a href="https://twitter.com/snekse/status/281500155713306626">Derek isn't coming</a>, <strong>we are going to postpone the party to Wednesday January 16 and it will still be at Beercade!</strong>  I want everyone to be safe and with the holidays coming up, drinking + blizzard probably isn't super smart.  We'll do the same party and same place next month.  </p>&#13;
<p>I wanted to wait to see if the weather would change for our favor.  I know many have made arrangements so its a shame to cancel at the last minute.  But that is how Nebraska weather is after all.</p>&#13;
<p>I think more people will be able to make it out to the party on Wednesday January 16th.  Besides, there isn't anything cool going on in January … until now.</p>&#13;
<p>I'll post an update in about a week about the party.  I'll make it worth the wait…</p>
