<p>Its time for another Beer &amp;&amp; Code.  Time to get out, get some good code written, talk to your friendly programmers and get primed for St. Patty's Day festivities the next day.  My guess is that it'll be a short night for some because of St. Patty's day, so prove me wrong.</p>&#13;
<p>As promised we'll do this one in mid-town.  Specifically in Dundee at the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Old-Dundee-Bar-Grill/134770567146">Old Dundee Bar.</a>  It was recommended by <a href="http://twitter.com/gabek/status/43097738052775936">@gabek</a>.  I called the Old Dundee Bar to be sure they had a working WIFI and I was assured it'll be up. </p>&#13;
<p>The other recommendation was from <a href="http://twitter.com/EvDrew/status/43141567745228800">@EvDrew</a> for the <a href="http://twitter.com/sidedoorlounge">Side Door</a>.  It sounds like a great place, but they don't open until 7pm.  I have added it to the list and we'll check it out soon.</p>&#13;
<p>See you Wednesday!</p>&#13;
<p>When:  Wednesday - March 16, 2011</p>&#13;
<p>Where:  Old Dundee Bar - 49th Dodge</p>&#13;
<p>When: 5pm - 9pm(ish). </p>
