<p>This month's Beer &amp;&amp; Code is the day after Valentines day.  Be sure to take our your real significant other the day after Valentines day for Beer &amp;&amp; Code.</p>&#13;
<p>Next week I am making good on our promise to a location out west.  We will meet a brand new bar called The Lauter <a href="http://www.thelautertun.com/">Tun (website</a>).  I was there earlier this week and its a fantastic bar with great brews on tap, many bottles, solid wifi. If you live out west and haven't been here, make sure you meet us there on Wednesday.  They don't have a big table, so we'll either all be at the bar or spread out.  </p>&#13;
<p>I'm told also, that live music will start between 7pm and 8pm.  I am guessing work will die off by then...</p>&#13;
<p>Day:  Wednesday Feburary 15, 2012 </p>&#13;
<p>Time:  5pm until 8pm.</p>&#13;
