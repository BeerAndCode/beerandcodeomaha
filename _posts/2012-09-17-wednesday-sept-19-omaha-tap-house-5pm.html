<p>Its time to prepare for cooler weather, fall projects and/or <a href="http://omaha.startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend</a>, by getting a frosty beverage at Omaha's newest craft brewery:  <a href="http://omahataphouse.com">Omaha Tap House</a>.  I like their menu and personally think I'll be trying the Ska Decadent on tap.  I'm excited to be working on some great new projects during the coming fall months and meet up with those attending before startup weekend.</p>&#13;
<p>I personally haven't been there, but have heard great things thus far.  </p>&#13;
