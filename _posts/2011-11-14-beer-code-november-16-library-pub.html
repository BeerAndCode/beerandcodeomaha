<p>November is here and I'm ready for another get together again!  This month I had planned to take us to the Side Door Lounge.  I found out late that they don't and (as I was told) will probably never have WIFI.  So I scratched that idea and went back to the drawing board.</p>&#13;
<p>Then I found a nifty sounding little bar called the <a href="http://www.librarypubomaha.com/">Library Pub</a>.  They claim to have more than 160 Craft Beers available, solid wifi and plenty of places to sit.  I have never been there personally, but I talked with the owner and he's excited to have us.  They don't have food, but lots to choose from for drinks, many spaces to sit, good wifi, and plenty of spots for power.   He said they play movies that night starting at around 10pm.  So if any of us have too many, there are movies to stick around and watch.  </p>&#13;
<p>PS - I'll be announcing a end of the year party here shortly.  Plans are coming together.</p>&#13;
<p>See you Wednesday! </p>&#13;
<p><strong>When</strong>:  Wednesday, November 16, 2011</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Time</strong>:  I'll be there at 5PM, most people show up around 6PM.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Where</strong>:  Library Pub (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=library+pub+omaha,+ne&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=41.305134,-96.053231&amp;spn=0.011235,0.013282&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=48.15347,54.404297&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;hq=library+pub&amp;hnear=Omaha,+Douglas,+Nebraska&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">google map location</a>) (<a href="http://www.librarypubomaha.com/">their website</a>)</p>
