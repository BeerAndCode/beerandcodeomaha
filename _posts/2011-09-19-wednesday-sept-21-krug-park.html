<p>Beer &amp;&amp; Code for September is happening at Krug Park.  I personally have never been here but Andrew Wirick <a href="https://twitter.com/amwirick/status/114705615082897408">tweeted it as a recommendation</a>.  If he approves, it has to be a good place.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Wednesday September 21, 2011</p>&#13;

<p>I have been told they can accommodate the group just fine.  I hear wifi is good.  I'm bringing an extension cable and power strip just in case.</p>&#13;
<p>Beers?  Wow, does it look like they have a lot.  Check out this picture from their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/krugpark?sk=info">Facebook page</a>:</p>&#13;
