<p>Yup!  We've been to Brazen Head before.  However, it went so well the last time its time to do it again.  Truth be told, the other place I called wasn't confident in their wifi.  See you Wednesday at 5pm or sometime after...</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Location:</strong>  <a href="http://www.brazenheadpub.com/">Brazen Head</a> (319 N. 78th Street)</p>&#13;
<p><strong>When:</strong>  Wednesday, July 20, 2010</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Starts:</strong>  5PM</p>&#13;

<p>Bring code and thirst for beer (or root beer)...</p>
