<p><a href="http://www.beerandcode.org/post/6496291698/wednesday-june-15-barfly">Beer &amp;&amp; Code is tonight, Wednesday starting around 5pm</a>.  Remember, I say starting because people come in when they want and leave when they want.  Most people come in around 5:30 or 6pm because that is when they leave work.  The leave by 9pm because they want to still see their families.  ... just a heads up on time.  </p>&#13;
<p>I (<a href="http://andypeters.org/">Andy Peters</a>) cannot make it tonight.  I have a very bad case of pink eye.  If I show up and ignore it, naturally I'll be the cause of a bunch of drunk, blind programmers.  If that should happen, I don't want it to happen because of me.</p>&#13;
<p>I also hear that <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/barflyomaha">Barfly</a> has Q98 showing up on Wednesdays.  I was not aware of that.  If this causes any problems tonight<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/boutcher/status/81064509745283073">, @boutcher suggests to move next store.</a>  I have had *so* many requests to setup a night at Barfly, so this seemed perfect.  I called them while on vacation and made sure everything is going to be okay for us (Wifi, power, enough seats, etc).  They didn't tell me about the radio station.  I am very sorry if it causes problems.</p>&#13;
<p>Good luck tonight.  I'll see you all at the next one...</p>&#13;
