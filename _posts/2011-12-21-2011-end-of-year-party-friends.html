<p>Besides being about beer and code; this so called group is about <em>community</em>.  Instead of reaching out to big companies for sponsorship for our party tonight, I wanted to reach out to people that make this event more like community.  Here is a little word about those people...</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Lyconic </strong></p>&#13;
<p><a href="http://lyconic.com">Lyconic</a> is a (web) software company with an office out in west Omaha.  <a href="http://twitter.com/alassek">Adam</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/aidenf77">Aron</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/existensil">Carl</a> are at Beer &amp;&amp; Code monthly events quite often.  These guys are always showing off some neat code.  Typically they do things a lot in Ruby on Rails and Postgresql these days. I know that they are currently hiring for a UX/UI guy.  Interested?  Drop them a line - jobs@lyconic.com.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Good-Twin</strong></p>&#13;
<p><a href="http://www.good-twin.com/">Good Twin</a> is an Omaha based branding, design, and development <em>collateral</em>.    You likely have run into <a href="http://twitter.com/amwirick">Andrew Wirick</a> a bunch of monthly events.  He's a well known JQuery guru and has helped people often at events; with code or beer tips.  He recently joined up with <a href="http://twitter.com/adamnielsen">Adam Nielsen</a> at Good Twin; a natural team up.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Slouch Couch</strong></p>&#13;
<p><a href="http://slouchcou.ch/">Slouch Couch</a> is a fun group of programmers dudes who show up to a lot Beer &amp;&amp; Code events.  These guys came out the recent <a href="http://omaha.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend Omaha</a> event in August.  They are going to setup a laptop to play their recent <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/game">SPN game</a>.  Play it.  Ask them about how they made it, what they used, etc.  Its buzzword compliant:  HTML5, Javascript, CSS, etc, etc, etc. based game.  <em>Playing the game will net you the chance to win a free tshirt too!</em></p>&#13;
<p><strong>Gabe Kangas</strong></p>&#13;
<p>(<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/gabek">Twitter</a>) A beer &amp;&amp; coder who comes to most of the monthly events.  He just wanted to throw in for the tab and say thanks to everyone.  Find him and ask him what he's working on.  He's been working with Slouch Couch and some iOS based development these days.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Ninth Division</strong></p>&#13;
<p><a href="http://www.ninthdivision.com">Ninth Division</a> is my company here in Omaha.  For the last three years we've built many different types of mobile apps for a number of clients; more known for the iPhone and iPad apps.  I'm looking forward to a big year next year with a few apps of our own planned.  Find me (<a href="http://twitter.com/andypeters">Andy Peters</a>) at the event and ask me about iOS and Android Development.  I'd love to find more people out there who are interested, currently coding for it, etc.</p>
