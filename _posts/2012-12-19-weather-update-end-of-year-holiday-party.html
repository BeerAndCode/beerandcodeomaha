<p>As you all know by now, we are under a <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NEZ052&amp;warncounty=NEC055&amp;firewxzone=NEZ052&amp;local_place1=&amp;product1=Winter+Storm+Warning">Winter Weather Warning</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>You may have also noticed that I announced on Twitter earlier <a href="http://twitter.com/BeerCodeOmaha/status/281380921280712704">that we will call whether we postpone or go ahead and party by 3PM by today</a>.  I am waiting until last minute because weather conditions may change; this is Nebraska after all.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>This party is for you.</strong>  So I'm asking that anyone who was planning to come tonight, reply / dm me on twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/beercodeomaha">@BeerCodeOmaha</a> or<a href="http://twitter.com/andypeters"> @andypeters</a>) if you not coming or still planning - either way.  Give me updates through the day even. If you don't have Twitter, email me - andy@ninthdivision.com.  </p>&#13;
<p>If by 3pm the majority of people are not coming then we will cancel for sure.  Other factors:  Beercade is closed, the city of Omaha is basically closed or Snowmaggedon is clearly on track to destroy us all.   I'll be in touch with Beercade this afternoon for advisement as well.</p>&#13;
<p>My concern is safety.  Party + Drinking + Epic Snow Storm = bad news for Beer &amp;&amp; Coders.  If we postpone it'll be for next month - probably 3rd Wednesday again.</p>&#13;
<p>I'll post on Twitter, this Blog, and the Google Groups an update again by 3PM today!</p>&#13;
<p>-Andy</p>&#13;
