<p>Hello everyone!  Its the middle of August already (goodbye summer).  Anyway, its time for this months Beer &amp;&amp; Code get together.  We are going to be heading downtown this month to <a href="http://www.blattbeer.com">The Blatt</a>!</p>&#13;

<p>The Blatt is a new pub with a great selection of craft beers and solid wifi.  It's located south of the new Ameritrade stadium.  Its my understanding that it is no coincidence that the name is the Blatt; as it comes from the (now decommissioned) Rosenblatt Stadium.  I'm pretty anxious to try it out.</p>&#13;
