<p><strong>(Updated:  Sorry for saying today, wednesday was the 16th).</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Beer &amp;&amp; Coders! </p>&#13;
<p>Its time again to meet up and have a drink, code and socialize.  Bring your laptops to Barfly Wednesday at 5pm (ish) for another Beer &amp;&amp; Code.  BarFly can be found just north of 114th and Dodge Street.  Its a big place, so there should more than enough room for us to take over the place with laptops.  </p>&#13;
