<p>Join everyone this Wednesday, February 16th.  We are planning a West Omaha event at the Tropics Bar and Grill; just south of 168th and Maple.  I'll be there at 5pm, so come anytime after that. </p>&#13;
<p>The good:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>They have great WIFI.  Its strong all around the building and so far every time I've been there it works.</li>&#13;
<li>Really nice owners.  Heck he said, we can bring extension cords, move tables, etc.</li>&#13;
<li>A great food menu; great burgers.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>The bad:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Their drink select isn't great.  They have Lucky Bucket, Boulevard, and a few others on tap, but nothing exotic.  Not a ton in bottles either.  Last time we were at Dundee Dell... no where near the selection.</li>&#13;
<li>The place is big, but there is really one spot in the entire place to plug in.  The owner said I could bring an extension cord and some power strips though.</li>&#13;
