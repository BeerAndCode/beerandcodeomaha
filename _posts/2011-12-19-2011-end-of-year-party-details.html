<div>&#13;
<p>Thats right, this week is the awesome beyond awesome "End of Year party" at Krug Park.  It's this Wednesday December 21 starting at (around) 5:00PM.  I thought you all should know some things before hand…</p>&#13;
<p><strong>RSVP</strong></p>&#13;
<p>It'd help us if you RSVP'd - <a href="http://twtvite.com/beercodeparty"><span>http://twtvite.com/beercodeparty</span></a> ... if you don't thats okay too.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Free beer.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>That's right, some of your friends are buying a round or two.  We will have tickets to hand out to you all when you get there to account for the purchase of a fine beer.  When you get there, someone will be handing these out.  These friends (and avid Beer &amp;&amp; Coders) include <a href="http://www.lyconic.com">Lyconic</a>, <a href="http://www.good-twin.com/">Good Twin</a>, <a href="http://gabekangas.com/">Gabe Kangas himself</a> and my home base <a href="http://www.ninthdivision.com">Ninth Division</a>.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Food</strong></p>&#13;
<p>There will be some basic appetizers and things to munch on.  We aren't going to have a full course meal for you.  So probably eat before hand.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Significant Others</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Your spouse is welcome, if you don't think they'd be too bored.  Hey this is a party after all...</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Krug Park</strong></p>&#13;
<p>As you know this is at Krug Park.  If you haven't been to Krug Park before, its fantastic.  They have so many great craft beers from all over there.  If you have been there, I know you'll return… just because of the spot.  Lets pack the place!  Invite other programmers who haven't been here before.  If this is your first time, come on out. </p>&#13;
<p><strong>Not a private event</strong></p>&#13;
<p>They are not closing the pub just for us beer driven programmers.  Just a heads up, normal people will be there too.  This is one of the reasons we'll also be doing a name tag thing.  </p>&#13;
<p><strong>Leave your laptops at home.</strong></p>&#13;
<p>This is a social event.  Leave the laptops at home or the office or whatever.  Plan on meeting a few new programmers and learning about what everyone is working on, good at, what their twitter handle is, github account is, etc.  Make some new connections and do a little bragging… its the end of the year.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>&#13;
<p>Beer &amp;&amp; Code is about Community.</p>&#13;
<p>I'm not an event planner.  Sorry if its a little rocky or "off".</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Enjoy yourself!</strong></p>&#13;
