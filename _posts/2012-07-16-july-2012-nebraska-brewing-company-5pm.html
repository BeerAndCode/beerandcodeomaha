<p>Well its freaking hot out there.  What better way to cool down than with with some code and a frosty brew from one of Nebraska's best brewers.  Join us all this Wednesday starting at 5PM at <a href="http://www.nebraskabrewingco.com/main.asp">Nebraska Brewing Company</a> in Papillion, NE.  </p>&#13;
<p>Last summer we visited Nebraska Brewing Company and it was a great time.  Just like last year, we have the upstairs booked.  I guess they are expecting a few parties, so be ready.  Also, if you are interested in tours of their facility I believe they do that too.</p>&#13;
<p>If anything, come out to hear me talk about Batman.</p>&#13;
