<p><strong><em>more beer, less code.</em></strong></p>&#13;
<p>Tuesday December 14, 2010 @ 6pm.</p>&#13;
<p>Upstream Brewery Legacy - 171th Center</p>&#13;
<p>During the month of December, Upstream has one of the best beers in Omaha:  <a href="http://www.upstreambrewing.com/SeasonBeers.aspx">The Ebenezer</a>.  They aren't paying me to say that and since (<a href="http://twitter.com/andypeters">@andypeters</a>) am organizing this event, I picked Upstream for this reason :).</p>&#13;
<p>Upstream <strong>has wifi</strong>, but <strong>it doesn't work well</strong> in my experience.  Also I figure with the holidays coming and the cold weather going we could also use more of a "social" time.  I know I'd like to hear about what your working on and what are your goals for next year.  Share with the rest there.  Meet some new people.  Take a moment to learn more about the folks you've seen or followed on twitter in the last few months.</p>&#13;
<p>Have you not been to a Beer and Code event?  Be sure to come this time!  <strong>Meet</strong> someone new.  <strong>Learn</strong> something new.  Find out why you should come to the next events?</p>&#13;
<p>Been to them before?  <strong>Bring</strong> a friend.  Show them what they are missing.  <strong>Introduce</strong> them to everyone.  Play pool.  Talk code.  Talk goals.  These are the people that can help; because we want to.  </p>&#13;
<p><strong>Every programmer is welcome!!!</strong></p>&#13;
<p>We have the <strong>small party room</strong> upstairs at the Upstream.  Its the room with the darts and the goofy paintings.  The reservation of the room includes one reserved pool table; we can always get more.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Next month/year</strong> will commence our normal Beer and Code schedule of events: <em>Bar, Wifi, Programmers, Laptops and Code</em>.</p>&#13;
