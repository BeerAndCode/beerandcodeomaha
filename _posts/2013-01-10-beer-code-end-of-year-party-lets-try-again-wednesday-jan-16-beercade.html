<p>Remember how last month we planned a fun end of the year party only to get <a href="http://www.beerandcode.org/day/2012/12/19">interrupted by the Omaha Doom Blizzard of 2012</a>?  The postponed party is still on for Wednesday Janurary 16 at Beercade.  Show up any time after 6pm and bring a friend if you like; this is a party.  </p>&#13;
<p>Just like the last few end of the year parties we've done, fellow Beer &amp;&amp; Coders chip in for a round or two.  So far I'm chipping in for a bunch of quarters and <a href="http://gabekangas.com/">Gabe Kangas</a> (fellow Omaha Beer &amp;&amp; Coder who is now in California) is chipping in for a round / or more quarters.  If you are interested in helping out, email me (<a href="mailto://andy@ninthdivision.com">andy@ninthdivision.com</a>) or contact me at the party.  </p>&#13;
