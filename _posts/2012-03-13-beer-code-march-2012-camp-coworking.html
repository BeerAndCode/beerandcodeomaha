<p class="p1">Hey everyone it is that time of the month again.  Time to get out and find a bunch of programmers doing their thing with a frosty brew.  The Beer &amp;&amp; Code has been traveling all around Omaha at different pubs, so I thought it was time to try something a little different.</p>&#13;
<p class="p1">This month we are going to venture to <a href="http://campcoworking.com/">CAMP Omaha</a>.  For those that don't know, CAMP is a CoWorking hotspot downtown at the Mastercraft Building.  I've personally been a drop in there a few times and I love the environment.  If you work for yourself, run a business, or something in between CAMP might be for you.  </p>&#13;
<p class="p1">They don't serve beer though.  So I'll be brining a case of beers for anyone.  I encourage you to bring a six pack, case, etc of something.  Do you brew your own?  Bring that to show it off to some others.  They have plenty of desks for us to work at, wifi (of course).</p>&#13;
<p class="p1">Since we'll be invading CAMP, I'd like to ask that some of us chip and drop a little donation to them.  Megan and Dave are great peeps and will likely be cleaning up our mess.  A small tip is the least we do.  It doesn't have to be much either.  I plan to drop them a sweet bill with Abraham Lincoln's face on it.  If we all do that, we can do more awesome parties there...</p>&#13;
<p class="p1">Date:  Wednesday March 21, 2012.</p>&#13;
<p class="p1">Time:  about 5pm until 8 or 9pm.</p>&#13;
<p class="p1">Where:  CAMP CoWorking - <a href="http://campcoworking.com/contact"><span class="s1">http://campcoworking.com/contact</span></a>  (Master craft building)</p>&#13;
<p class="p1">Parking:  Pull into the master craft building and there a lot of parking there.  The door to the building is on the south side (where you enter).</p>
