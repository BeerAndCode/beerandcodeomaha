<p>Mark your calendar for <strong>Wednesday December 21, 2011</strong>!  We are having another end of the year celebration.  Thats right, you made it this far... time to have a fine beer and chat with fellow programmers!</p>&#13;
<p>Last year I sort of threw together off the cuff a end of the year celebration at Upsteam.  A lot of people showed up and it was a good time.  Who knew!?  This year, we're "knocking it up a notch" (<a href="http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Elzar">Futurama joke</a>).  The party is at <strong>Krug Park</strong>.  ... Krug Park, was such a great place we wanted to have a bigger party there.</p>&#13;
<p>Show up thirsty for beer and good conversations.  Leave the laptops at home this time, as its mostly a social thing (unless you want to bring the laptops to work or show off some great work; this is Beer &amp;&amp; Code after all).  </p>&#13;
<p><strong>Spread the word to other programmers.  It'd be great to have a great turn out!</strong></p>&#13;
<p>I'm still putting together the final details, so watch the website for more details. </p>&#13;
