<p>June 2012 is here, and we have a great location lined up for this month's: <a href="http://www.covisco.com">CoVis Co-Working</a>.  Be there this Wednesday!  </p>&#13;
<p>CoVis CoWorking is providing some beers for everyone, but feel free to bring your own as well.  If you remember a few months back we visited CAMP CoWorking, now we are visiting this CoWorking facility.</p>&#13;
<p>For those that don't already know, <a href="http://www.covisco.com/">CoVis CoWorking </a>is a new co-working facility located just off i680 and Pacific. It's in the red brick buildings called "Shaker Place" next door to Minute Man Printing and a Massage Facility.  Skid Vis said he'd be buy a couple cases of beers for everyone, but also feel free to bring your own brews!  There is a good sized refrigerator, so everything will stay cool.  Also, there is plenty of parking in the area so don't worry about that.</p>&#13;
<p><em>CoVis CoWorking opens their doors all day free of charge every Wednesday for #CoWorkingWednesday.  </em>Beer &amp;&amp; Code officially gets started around 5pm on Wednesday, but feel free to stop by earlier!  You are invited to stop by all day long, or just a bit earlier to get the Beer &amp;&amp; Code party started earlier.  Remember that also, if this Wednesday doesn't work for you.</p>&#13;
<p>Time:  5PM - 8PM (or when people leave...)</p>&#13;
<p>Date:  Wednesday June 20, 2012</p>&#13;
<p>Location:  CoVis CoWorking (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=covis+coworking&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=41.255549,-96.082649&amp;spn=0.040974,0.104628&amp;sll=41.249825,-96.082677&amp;sspn=0.040977,0.104628&amp;t=m&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A">map</a>)</p>&#13;
