<p>The first Beer &amp;&amp; Code of 2012.  We are doing it at the downtown location of Up Stream.  I picked a downtown location for the folks that wanted to goto the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/144167815694165/">Silicon Prairie Meetup</a>.  I will be going early on for a drink and then heading over to Beer &amp;&amp; Code.  I have the table reserved starting at 5pm.  I probably won't be there until closer to 5:45pm is my guess.  Just a heads up...</p>&#13;
<p>We are supposed have a table upstairs by some outlets.  When you get there, tell them you are here for the Beer &amp;&amp; Code party.  They will likely look at you weird (as usual) but that is the name its under.  ;)  I've been assured that their wifi is solid by a few people there.</p>&#13;
<p>Where:  Up Stream Downtown (<a href="http://upstreambrewing.com/Hours.aspx">website</a>).  - upstairs.</p>&#13;
<p>When:  Wednesday 1/18/2011</p>&#13;
<p>Time: 5PM - 8PM.  (same time as SPN's meet up).</p>&#13;
<p>... Hope to see you there!  </p>
